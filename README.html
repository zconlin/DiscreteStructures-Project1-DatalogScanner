<p>
Note: Projects are to be completed by each student individually
(not by groups of students).
</p>

<p>
Note: Projects must be passed-off
with a TA to be given credit.
</p>
 
<p>
Note: You may not use a regular expression library for this project.
</p>

<p>
Write a scanner that reads a sequence of characters from a text file,
identifies the datalog language tokens found in the file,
and outputs each token.
</p>


<h3>
Example Input
</h3>

<pre>
Queries:
   marriedTo ('Bea' , 'Zed')?

Rules:
   marriedTo( X,Y ) :- marriedTo(Y,X) .


</pre>


<h3>
Example Output
</h3>

<pre>(QUERIES,"Queries",2)
(COLON,":",2)
(ID,"marriedTo",3)
(LEFT_PAREN,"(",3)
(STRING,"'Bea'",3)
(COMMA,",",3)
(STRING,"'Zed'",3)
(RIGHT_PAREN,")",3)
(Q_MARK,"?",3)
(RULES,"Rules",5)
(COLON,":",5)
(ID,"marriedTo",6)
(LEFT_PAREN,"(",6)
(ID,"X",6)
(COMMA,",",6)
(ID,"Y",6)
(RIGHT_PAREN,")",6)
(COLON_DASH,":-",6)
(ID,"marriedTo",6)
(LEFT_PAREN,"(",6)
(ID,"Y",6)
(COMMA,",",6)
(ID,"X",6)
(RIGHT_PAREN,")",6)
(PERIOD,".",6)
(EOF,"",8)
Total Tokens = 26
</pre>



<h3>
Example Input
</h3>

<pre>,
'a string'
# a comment
Schemes
FactsRules
::-

</pre>


<h3>
Example Output
</h3>

<pre>(COMMA,",",1)
(STRING,"'a string'",2)
(COMMENT,"# a comment",3)
(SCHEMES,"Schemes",4)
(ID,"FactsRules",5)
(COLON,":",6)
(COLON_DASH,":-",6)
(EOF,"",7)
Total Tokens = 8
</pre>



<h3>
Testing
</h3>

<p>
Here are some ideas for tests.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
An empty input file.
</li><li>
A colon immediately followed by another token
   (no space between the colon and the next token).
</li><li>
An identifier that contains a number.
</li><li>
An identifier that contains a keyword.
</li><li>
An empty string (nothing between the quotes '').
</li><li>
An unterminated string.
</li></ol>



<h3>
Design
</h3>

<p>
You will build a datalog parser in the next project.
The datalog parser will read tokens from the datalog scanner.
The scanner should be designed such that the parser
is able to easily get the tokens from the scanner.
</p>



<h3>
White Space
</h3>

<p>
White space is a sequence of space, tab, or newline characters.
Your lexer should always skip over white space between tokens.
White space is not completely ignored because
it is sometimes needed to separate tokens.
For the C++ language, an easy way to recognize
white space characters is to use the 'isspace' function.
</p>



<!--

comments are defined in table for now

<h3>
Line Comments
</h3>

<p>
A line comment starts with a hash character (#) and
ends at the end of the line or end of the file.
</p>

<h3>
Block Comments
</h3>

<p>
A block comment starts with #| and ends with |#.
Block comments may cover multiple lines.
Block comments can be empty
and multiple comments can appear on the same line.
The line number for a comment token
is the line where the comment begins.
If a block comment is not terminated
(end of file is encountered before the end of the comment),
the token becomes an undefined token.
</p>
-->



<h3>
Output Format
</h3>

<p>
The expected output is a list of the tokens found in the input
file followed by a count of the number of tokens found.
The tokens are output one token per line.
</p>
<p>
Each line has the form:
</p>
<pre>(type,"value",line)
</pre>
<p>
The 'type' must be one of the types listed in the table.
The 'value' is the actual input text that forms the token.
The 'line' is the line number where the token is found.
Notice there are no spaces on either side of the commas
separating the token's elements. 
</p>
<p>
The last line of output has the form:
</p>
<pre>Total Tokens = N
</pre>
<p>
where 'N' is the number of tokens found.
</p>



<h3>
Input Errors
</h3>

<p>
When the input contains errors,
output tokens with the type UNDEFINED.
</p>

<p>
Undefined tokens are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
A single character that cannot be
the first character of a valid token.
</li><li>
A string that is not terminated.
</li><li>
A comment that is not terminated.
</li></ol>

<h4>
Example Input
</h4>

<pre>Facts:
$
Rules:
</pre>

<h4>
Example Output
</h4>

<pre>(FACTS,"Facts",1)
(COLON,":",1)
(UNDEFINED,"$",2)
(RULES,"Rules",3)
(COLON,":",3)
(EOF,"",4)
Total Tokens = 6
</pre>



<h3>

the scanner would find two tokens:
an 'undefined' token made from the character "1"
and an 'identifier' token made from the
characters "stPerson".

<tr>
<td class="center">STRING</td>
<td class="widthLimit">
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes.
White space (space, tab) is not skipped when inside a string.
Two adjacent single quotes within a string denote an apostrophe.
The line number for a string token
is the line where the string begins.
If a string is not terminated
(end of file is encountered before the end of the string),
the token becomes an undefined token.

<br>
<br>
The 'value' of a token printed to the output is the
sequence of input characters that form the token.
For a string token this means that two adjacent single quotes in
the input are printed as two adjacent single quotes in the output.
(In other words, don't convert two adjacent single quotes
in a string to just one apostrophe in the output.)
